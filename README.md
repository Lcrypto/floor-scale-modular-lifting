# floor-scale-modular-lifting
The GitHub repository contains a C++ tool for Floor-Scale Modular lifting of MET-LDPC codes with ACE and Code distance Upper bound Constrains based on the work by I. Vorobyev, N. Polyanskii, G. Svistunov, S. Egorov, and V. Usatyuk, "Generalization of Floor Lifting for QC-LDPC Codes: Theoretical Properties and Applications," published in the 2018 IEEE East-West Design & Test Symposium.

This tool is used to change the circulant size of Quasi-cyclic LDPC codes without puncturing and shortening, just by operating on the largest size circulant. The proposed approach greatly improves the modular lifting method and has theoretical proof of improvement of short cycle breaking.

The implementation provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in improving the performance of QC-LDPC codes on the waterfall and error-floor region. It also greatly reduces memory consumption for storing parity-check matrices of different lengths (sizes).

Overall, this repository offers a comprehensive C++ tool for Floor-Scale Modular lifting of MET-LDPC codes with ACE and Code distance Upper bound Constrains. Researchers and practitioners will find this tool valuable in exploring various strategies for designing efficient error-correction systems with high-performance rates and low memory consumption.
